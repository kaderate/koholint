# Link has no fixed OAM slot -- the game reassigns which of the 40 sprite slots renders him
# between frames. find_link works around this by exclusion: read all active (on-screen) OAM
# sprites, drop any whose (Y, X) matches a known-stationary NPC, and treat what remains as Link.
# Good enough for a single room with no wandering third sprite; would need a real WRAM address
# for rooms with moving enemies/NPCs alongside Link.
#
# Movement is tile-locked: a directional press held for >=1 frame commits to one fixed,
# deterministic trajectory that plays out over ~22-28 frames regardless of how much longer the
# key stays held (measured via a fork-per-trial hold-duration sweep, holds of 1/2/4/8/16 frames
# all produced byte-identical trajectories). Two outcomes only: it resolves to +/-~14px along the
# pressed axis (a completed step -- not exactly TILE_SIZE, empirically ~14px), or it bounces back
# to within a few px of the starting position (blocked by a collision). Reading position before
# that settle window closes is what produced the earlier 7-31px noise (see docs/archive/EXPLORATION_LOG.md) --
# it was catching different mid-animation frames, not measuring real per-tap variance.
# Resolved via $LOAD_PATH, not require_relative: this file moved from gemboy's lib/ to koholint's
# legacy/, and profiling/utils.rb still lives in a gemboy checkout (see README.md "Dependency on
# gemboy") -- the caller is expected to $LOAD_PATH.unshift(".../gemboy/profiling") first.
