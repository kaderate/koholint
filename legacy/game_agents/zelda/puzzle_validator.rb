# A hypothesis may only cite entity IDs that actually exist in the bounded packet. This is
# mechanical enforcement, not self-restraint: it doesn't stop pretrained knowledge from
# *influencing* which hypothesis gets ranked first, but it does catch the concrete failure mode
# of a hypothesis leaning on an item/mechanic that was never observed in this playthrough (e.g.
# "use the sword" when inventory.items_held is empty and no object called a sword exists).

# Common LA-lore item/mechanic names that must NEVER appear ungrounded -- if inventory or
# objects don't actually contain them, citing them is a strong signal the hypothesis leaned on
# outside knowledge of the game rather than the observed packet. Deliberately broad and easy to
# extend; false positives (a legitimate future in-packet object named similarly) are cheap to
# re-check by hand, false negatives (missing a real leak) are the expensive failure mode.
