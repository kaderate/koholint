# Persistent, cumulative catalog of BG tile classifications, keyed by TilemapReader's
# pattern_hash (stable across screens/VRAM banks -- see tilemap_reader.rb). The premise this
# exploits: a background tile never changes what it *is* over the course of the game (grass is
# always grass, a wall is always a wall -- see docs/archive/EXPLORATION_LOG.md's navigation overhaul writeup), so
# once a tile is classified here it never needs re-testing on any future screen. That's the whole
# point versus RoomMap::Recorder's per-screen empirical rediscovery: the number of `unknown` tiles
# on a new screen should trend toward zero as the catalog grows.
#
# `passable_from` records confirmed ENTRY directions only (never inferred as symmetric) -- this is
# how an asymmetric obstacle (e.g. a ledge you can leap down but not climb back up, confirmed in
# the game's own manual as a basic, itemless move -- see docs/archive/EXPLORATION_LOG.md) is represented: its
# passable_from might be `["down"]` while `["up"]` stays untested or confirmed blocked separately.
# An empty passable_from does NOT necessarily mean "wall forever" -- `requires_item` captures the
# manual's own note that water is crossed automatically once Flippers are obtained, implying it's
# likely a hard block before that (a hypothesis, not yet confirmed on this save file).
