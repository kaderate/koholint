  # before it's trusted as a real obstacle and blacklisted -- one noisy sample shouldn't poison
  # the persisted grid and wall off a cell that's actually fine from a different approach.
  #
  # Position tracking: the OAM-to-cell rounding is only trusted ONCE, to anchor the very first
  # cell. From there, the current cell is tracked by exact integer accumulation of move_tiles's
  # own (already-precise, see the movement model in docs/archive/EXPLORATION_LOG.md) moved-tile counts, never by
  # re-rounding a fresh OAM read. Repeatedly re-rounding turned out to be the actual root cause of
  # the previous session's contradictory "blocked cell" reports in this room's narrow corridor --
  # the rounding itself was ambiguous near cell boundaries, not the underlying geometry.
