# Builds one screen's directional collision grid (see ScreenGrid), keyed by exact gameplay-cell
# coordinates (see TileClassifier) instead of RoomMap::Recorder's fuzzy pixel-snapped nodes -- no
# SNAP_RADIUS ambiguity. The point: a direction is only physically tested if the target cell's
# tiles aren't already resolvable from the shared TileCatalog (a wall stays a wall, grass stays
# grass), so re-exploring a screen (or one sharing tiles with an already-explored one) costs less
# live testing over time. RoomMap::Recorder is the cross-check: it explores blind, this reads
# tiles first, and the two graphs should agree (see docs/archive/EXPLORATION_LOG.md).
